Use the details provided from official sources to ensure accuracy.PMUY: name, DOB, BPL info, Aadhar, LPG type, bank+IFSC, KYC, signature.Ladli Behna: name, age, Sumagr/Aadhar, marital status, address, income, bank, photo, signature.Mahila Samriddhi: name, DOB, age, address, Aadhar, residency proof, bank, income, LPG, photo, signature.Sukanya Samriddhi: girl child and guardian details, Aadhar, address, branch, nominee, signature.Kishori Shakti: teen‚Äôs details, guardian info, Aadhar, address, income, school, health fields, signature.CM Parivar Samridhi: family head, Aadhar, category, bank, selected pension scheme, signature.For each form:Include camera capture or upload for applicant photo and signature canvas.Include validation rules (age ranges, mandatory IDs, bank fields, etc.).Add descriptive placeholders and tooltips.Ensure form data maps correctly to PDF output.Provide JSON schema definitions, UI layout instructions, and field-by-field placeholders (<field_id>, label, type, validation). Also include a voice-guided example flow for at least one form (e.g. PMUY): AI voice prompts, speech-to-text expectations, confirmation steps.there should be an option to upload documents also where documents necessary for respective schemes to upload camera should open and user shows the document on camera and it scans and stores and uploads that document
make sure that voice assistant first speaks the name of the field then listens and recognizes user voice input and fill it in the field
